       "'The iStruct robot from DFKI draws inspiration from biological models to improve the mobility and efficiency of locomotive robots. The Challenge:\\n  - Locomotive robots could prove useful in a variety of ways, especially by performing tasks that can be dangerous to humans, such as assisting during natural disasters. However, creating machines that move as quickly and fluidly as animals is a challenging task. Benefits\\n\\nImproved locomotion Improved flexibility \\n\\n\\nApplications\\n\\nRobotics \\n\\n\\nUN Sustainable Development Goals Addressed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoal 9: Industry Innovation & Infrastructure Innovation Details:\\n  - The iStruct robot contains biologically-inspired structural elements which effectively improve the locomotion and mobility of the robot. Rigid connecting elements are extended to single more flexible subsystems, and important sections of the robot have been protected against impacts and abrupt movements as well as vibrations. Biological Model:\\n  - Animals utilize locomotion to evade predators, move towards food, or migrate to a new habitat or breeding ground. Several components, including muscle and bone flexibility, reactive processing, and decision making are essential for survival.\\nVertebrates (Mammals, Fish, Birds,\\xa0Reptiles)\\nSkeletal muscles contract and relax, generating force and enabling\\xa0movement.'"
